Uncomment the `oktaJwtVerifier` object. Your Okta org URL is pulled from the environment variables you previously set.**\n\n\nNote: If you are curious about where to find the keys endpoint and other OpenID Connect related endpoints, you can find them by visiting your [Okta Org Authorization Server's metadata endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#org-authorization-server). The metadata url will look something like this `https://{yourOktaDomain}/.well-known/openid-configuration` and you can visit it directly from the browser. \n\n",
